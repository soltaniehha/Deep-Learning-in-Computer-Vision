# Deep-Learning-in-Computer-Vision
This repository contains material for the python workshop on deep learning in computer vision.

We start with the basics of python, and get to work with some of the fundamental python libraries for data science such as: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and more. We then dive into `Keras` with `tensorflow` backend and focus on image classification tasks. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models we create varry from fully training to transfer learning to fine-tuning with transfer learning. Students will complete this workshop by working on a dataset of their choice to train a fully functioning model using Keras.

## Acknowledgment

* Notebooks in Python Basics folder come from [*A Whirlwind Tour of Python*](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp) (free [100-page pdf](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf)) by Jake VanderPlas (under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) license). Slight modifications and updates have been made in some places to keep its content up to date. *A Whirlwind Tour of Python* is a fast-paced introduction to essential components of the Python language for data science and/or scientific programming. This material was written and tested using **Python 3.7**, and should work for any Python 3.X version.
